# Summary of Changes for Streaming Implementation

To implement the separated streaming and non-streaming execution paths, the following changes were made across the codebase. The core idea was to create parallel methods (`execute` vs. `execute_stream` and `process_turn` vs. `process_stream_turn`) to handle each case cleanly.

### New Files Created

1.  **`STREAMING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** This markdown file was created in the project root to document the high-level architectural plan for these changes. It explains the "why" behind the code modifications and serves as a reference for future development.

### Existing Files Edited

1.  **`crates/core/src/agent/executor.rs`**
    *   **Action:** Modified the `AgentExecutor` trait.
    *   **Details:**
        *   Added a new method signature for `execute_stream` to the `AgentExecutor` trait.
        *   This new method has the exact same signature as the existing `execute` method, providing a parallel entry point for streaming.
        *   Added a default implementation for `execute_stream` that returns an `Unsupported` error. This ensures that any existing agent executors that don't support streaming will not break and will clearly state their capability.

2.  **`crates/core/src/agent/prebuilt/react.rs`**
    *   **Action:** This file saw the most significant changes to separate the core logic.
    *   **Details:**
        *   **Restored `process_turn`:** The `process_turn` method was reverted to its original, purely non-streaming logic. It now makes a single, blocking call to the LLM and processes the complete response.
        *   **Created `process_stream_turn`:** A new `process_stream_turn` method was created. This method now contains all the logic for handling a streaming turn:
            *   It calls the `chat_stream_with_tools` endpoint on the LLM.
            *   It iterates over the asynchronous stream of response chunks.
            *   It reconstructs tool calls from the streamed chunks.
            *   It processes the tool calls and manages memory for the turn.
        *   **Implemented `execute_stream`:** The new `execute_stream` method from the `AgentExecutor` trait was implemented. This method contains the turn-based loop that repeatedly calls `process_stream_turn` until the agent's task is complete.
        *   The existing `execute` method continues to call the non-streaming `process_turn` in a loop.

3.  **`examples/react-agent-structured.rs`** (and other relevant examples)
    *   **Action:** Modified the example to demonstrate the new streaming functionality.
    *   **Details:**
        *   A command-line flag (e.g., `--stream`) was added to allow the user to choose the execution mode.
        *   Based on this flag, the `main` function in the example now conditionally calls either `agent.execute(...)` for the standard behavior or `agent.execute_stream(...)` to run the new streaming path. This serves as a practical example of how to use the new feature.

By making these changes, we've successfully created two distinct and maintainable execution paths, directly addressing maintainer feedback while preserving all existing functionality.
