# Coding Agent Example

A ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) based coding agent that demonstrates file manipulation capabilities similar to AI coding assistants. This agent systematically reasons through tasks and uses tools to search, read, write, and analyze code files in a project.

## Use Cases

### Interactive Coding Agent
```sh
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
